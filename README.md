# Spam classification
We will use the SMS Spam Collection dataset from Kaggle to build a classifier.

Over the years E-Mail and phone providers have successfully build anti-spam filters with a high success rate. Spam messages are not only annoying but dangerous. Most of them are send out to steal data from users, in this day and age where technology is evolving people find methods and tricks that actually beat the Anti-Spam filters, e.g. use of random sender addresses. That is why a very good and robust anti-spam filter is essential. 

Over the years machine learning methods have proven themselves and have beaten knowledge engineering when it comes to efficiency. Algorithms like Naive Bayes, support vector machine and K-nearest neighbour can be used for E-Mail filtering.

In this project I want to build a spam classifier on my own, by using the above mentioned algorithms. The goal of this project is to find a classifier that delivers a high accuracy rate for this dataset.

I will seperate the project in to three parts. 
- First part we will do some Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA), this will help us to study our data.
- Secondly we will build the three different classifiers using NB, SVM and Knn.
- Last but not least we will measure the accuracy of each classifier to determin which classifier performs best on our dataset.
