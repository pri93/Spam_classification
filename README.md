# Spam classification
We will use the SMS Spam Collection dataset from Kaggle to build a classifier.

Over the years E-Mail and phone providers have successfully build anti-spam filters with a high success rate. Spam messages are not only annoying but dangerous. Most of them are send out to steal data from users, in this day and age where technology is evolving people find methods and tricks that actually beat the Anti-Spam filters, e.g. use of random sender addresses. That is why a very good and robust anti-spam filter is essential. 

Machine learning methods have proven themselves and have beaten knowledge engineering when it comes to efficiency. One of them is the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is based on the Bayes Theorem. This classifier is not only robust but also easy to implement, accurate and fast.
Algorithms like Naive Bayes, support vector machine and K-nearest neighbour can be used for E-Mail filtering.

In this project I am building a simple spam classifier, by using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

This project is divided into three parts: 
- First part we will do some Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA), this will help us to get to know the data.
- Secondly we will build the a classifier using Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm.
- Last but not least we will measure the accuracy of the classifier and give insight on different ways to improve the performance of this classifier.
